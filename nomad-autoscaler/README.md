Once an issue exists, you can modify the code and raise a PR against this repo. We are working on increasing code coverage, please ensure that your work has at least 80% test coverage before submitting.


## Testing:

The project has two types of test, pure code Unit tests and, Functional tests which apply real blueprints to a locally running Docker engine and test output.

### Unit tests:

To run the unit tests you can use the make recipie `make test_unit` this runs the `go test` and excludes the functional tests.

```shell
shipyard on  master via 🐹 v1.13.5 on 🐳 v19.03.5 () 
➜ make test_unit

```

### Functional tests:

To run the functional tests ensure that Docker is running in your environment then run `make test_functional`. unctional tests are executed with GoDog cucumber test runner for Go. Note: These tests execute real blueprints and can a few minutes to run.

```shell
➜ make test_functional 
cd ./functional_tests && go test -v ./...
